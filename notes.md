1. Give background
    a) History
        #. Roman/Greek
            * Many inhabited 'worlds'
                + Ptolemaic Universe : central earth, star, moon and fixed stars
                + Pythagoreans, Democritus, Leucippus, Lucretius, Plutarch
                + "It seems absurd that in a large field only one stalk should grow and in
                   infinte space only one world exist"
            * Only one habited world
                + Plato : earth is unique
                + Aristotle - universe is finite        
        #. Christian : 
            * St. Augustine (6th century), Peter 3:18
                + Christ's uniqueness. Appeared only once in the Universe
                + Views that universe is created for man
        #. Midieval
            * St. Albertus Magnus
                + "Do there exist many worlds or is there but a single world? This is one of 
                   the most noble and exalted questions in the study of Nature"
                    - Plurality of worlds, means pluarlity of Incarnations
            * St. Thomas Aquinas 
                + Pupil of Albertus Magnus
                + Founder of scholastic philosophy
                    - If god made many similar worlds, they would be in vain and inconsistent
                      with Divine Wisdom.
            * Giordano Bruno 
                + martyr of science
                + Defended Copernican System
                + Use it to attack basic tenents of Christianity
                + Burned at stake (graphic here) for attack on religion, not copernican
                  beliefs
        #. Renassaince
            * Galileo
                + Jilted by Bruno's antagonism
                + Third letter on sunspots
                    - "as false and damnable the view of those who would put inhabitants on 
                       Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the Moon, meaning by 'inhabitants' animals
                       like ours and men in particular
            * Kepler 
                + Believed in life on other planets, but inferior to humans
                + Planets around other stars - unsolved.
                    - "No moons have yet been seen revolving around [the stars]. Hence this 
                       will remain an open question until this phenomenon too is detected"
                + No infitinite worlds b/c of many duplications
            * Tycho Brahe
                + Nothing useful, just had an artificial nose
                + Exhumed not once but twice!
                + Astronomer w/o telescopes
                + Worked with kepler as his assistent
                + Brass nose. Damn sword fights
                + Crown's astrologer
                + Per Kepler - failed to take a piss and got an infection
                + Wrote his own epitaph - ""He lived like a sage and died like a fool.""
            * Copernican revolution
                + Earth demoted from center of the universe to just one of six planets
                    - mountains on moon, moons around Jupiter
                + Discovery of North and South America, 
                + Principle of plenitude 
                + Plurality of worlds around other stars with intelligent beings
                + "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" - Bernard de Fontenelle (1686)
            * Christian Huygens (Dutch)
                + "The Celestrial Worlds Discovered"
        #. Enlightenment
            * Thomas Paine : "Age of Reason" (1794)
                + From whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the
                  Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protec-
                  tion, should quit the care of all the rest, and come to die in our world, be-
                  cause, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple! And, on
                  the other hand, are we to suppose that every world in the boundless cre-
                  ation had an Eve, an apple, a serpent, and a redeemer? In this case, the
                  person who is irreverently called the Son of God, and sometimes God
                  himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to
                  world, in an endless succession of death, with scarcely a momentary
                  interval of life "
